STEP 2. Use a file of possible passphrase combinations. A great tool to help build a wrodlist is called mentalist and can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/sc0tfree/mentalist/releases)) Read the docs and build out a wordlist. Afterwards click Start Recovery and watch as the tool will iterate through the list to try and discover the correct password
